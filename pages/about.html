                            As a versatile creative with a strong foundation in both graphic design and programming, I bring a unique perspective to digital projects. With 7 years of graphic design experience gained during high school and 3 years of formal programming education in college, I'm well-equipped to tackle challenges from concept to launch.<br><br>
                            My approach combines artistic vision with technical expertise, allowing me to create visually striking solutions that are both functional and user-friendly. Feel free to check out my <a href="projects.html">projects</a> on this website.<br><br>
                            I'm passionate about leveraging my dual skillset to craft innovative web experiences and am excited to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of design and technology.
